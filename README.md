# EcomInsightsSQL
SQL analysis of e-commerce data to gain insights into sales, inventory, suppliers, and shipping performance. Includes queries to optimize business decisions and improve operational efficiency.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project leverages SQL to conduct a thorough analysis of sales, supply chain, and inventory performance for an electronics e-commerce retailer. By using realistic, synthetic business data, the analysis covers a variety of key metrics such as top-selling products, supplier performance, inventory turnover, and shipping efficiency.

Advanced SQL techniquesâ€”including aggregations, joins, subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and window functionsâ€”are applied to solve real-world business problems and uncover actionable insights that can optimize sales, improve inventory management, and strengthen supplier relationships.
